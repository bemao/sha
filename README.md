# sha
Python implementation of SHA1 and SHA256 algorithms (no external dependencies).

This was done mostly for academic purposes. For production hashing, existing libraries (e.g. `hashlib`) are faster and provide more options.

See related blog post here.

### Usage
```
python sha.py <input_file> <OPTIONAL sha1 | sha256>
```
