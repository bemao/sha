# sha
Python implementation of SHA1 and SHA256 algorithms (no external dependencies).

This was done for academic purposes. For production hashing, existing libraries (e.g. `hashlib`) are faster and provide more options.

See related blog post [here](https://bryanjohns.substack.com/p/bits-bytes-and-hex-digits).

### Usage
```
python sha.py <input_file> <OPTIONAL sha1 | sha256>
```
